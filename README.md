# timedQuiz

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a fun trivia based quiz for users to enjoy. The project has a clock that counts down and time is subtracted off for each wrong answer to add to the thrill. This is a great concept which drills local storage and use of javascript functions and arrays.

## Table of Contents (Optional)
